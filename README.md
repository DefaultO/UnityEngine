This collection of Unitys important Dynamic Link Libraries is here so I can use newer Unity Functions in older Games made in older Unity Versions when creating Mono Internal Game Hacks.

Much ❤️ from me to them for collecting these and publishing them onto GitHub
Saved me some time, hope it did that for you too.
